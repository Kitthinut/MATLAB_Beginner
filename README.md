# MATLAB Roadmap: Step-by-Step Learning

Nothing Much, This is just my memo about basic MATLAB but if anyone is interest in it, feel free to use.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `beginner.m` ‚Äì Main script covering all steps.

---

## üìù Overview

This roadmap is designed to guide users through essential MATLAB capabilities:

### Step 1: Interface & Command Basics
- Basic arithmetic and variables
- `clear`, `save`, and `load` commands
- Displaying output using `fprintf`

### Step 2: Vector & Matrix Operations
- Creating vectors and matrices
- Indexing and element-wise operations
- Matrix multiplication

### Step 3: Visualization
- Line plotting (`plot`) with customization
- Subplots for multiple graphs
- Grid, labels, and titles

### Step 4: Calculus Tools
- Symbolic differentiation and integration (`syms`, `diff`, `int`)
- Numerical integration using `trapz`

### Step 5: ODE Solving
- Solving ordinary differential equations (`ode45`)
- Plotting solution curves

### Step 6: Simulation & Animation
- Simple pendulum animation
- Dynamic plotting using `drawnow` and `pause`

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Run `beginner.m` in the MATLAB editor or command window.
4. Follow prompts in the Command Window for animations and figure displays.

```matlab
clc
run('beginner.m')
